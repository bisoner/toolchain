* [Standard Template Library](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Template_Library) - The Standard Template Library (STL).

## Frameworks
*C++ generic frameworks and libraries.*

* [Qt](https://www.qt.io/download-open-source/) :zap: - A cross-platform application and UI framework. [GPL/LGPL/Commercial]

## Artificial Intelligence

## Documentation

* [doxygen](https://github.com/doxygen/doxygen) :zap: - The de facto standard tool for generating documentation from annotated C++ sources. [GPL2] [website](https://www.doxygen.org)

## Game Engine

* [Cocos2d-x](http://www.cocos2d-x.org/) - A multi-platform framework for building 2d games, interactive books, demos and other graphical applications. [MIT]

## JSON
